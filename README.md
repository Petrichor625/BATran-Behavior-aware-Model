# BATran: Behavior-aware Model
This repository is the code of Achieving-Human-Like-Trajectory-Prediction-in-Autonomous-Vehicles-A-Behavior-Aware-Approach.

# Abstract
The ability to accurately predict the trajectories of surrounding vehicles is a crucial obstacle that must be overcome in the journey towards fully autonomous vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce a behavior-aware model for trajectory prediction that incorporates theories and findings from the fields of human behavior, decision-making, theory of mind, etc. This model is comprised of behavior-aware, interaction-aware, priority-aware, and position-aware modules that analyze and interpret a variety of inputs, perceive and comprehend underlying interactions, and take into account uncertainty and variability in prediction. We evaluate the performance of our model using the NGSIM dataset and show that it outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency. Even when trained on a reduced portion of the training data, specifically 25\%, our model outperforms all baselines, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency in predicting future vehicle trajectories and the potential to lower the amount of data required for training autonomous vehicles, particularly in corner cases. In conclusion, the behavior-aware model represents a major advancement in the development of autonomous vehicles capable of predicting trajectories with the same level of proficiency as human drivers.

**The code for the project will be coming soon.**
